David Mantilla-Calderon, Kevin Huang, Aojie Li, Kaseba Chibwe, Xiaoqian Yu, Yinyin Ye, Lei Liu and Fangqiong Ling. Meta-analyses on SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Levels in Wastewater and Their Correlations to Epidemiological Indicators. Environ. Sci.: Water Res. Technol., 2022. Accepted Manuscript.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D2EW00084A

The dataset comprises qPCR/dPCR detections of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels in wastewater and COVID-19 case records for the date of sample collection in the associated geographical locations. Data were extracted from 20 publications, resulting in a total of 1751 observations retrieved. Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual observation. In addition, the dataset contains metadata associated with each observation, including study information, sample environment, and assay information.

Detailed descriptions of data extraction and metadata collection procedures are provided in the publication.
